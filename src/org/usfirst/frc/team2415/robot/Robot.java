/**
 * This is a demo program showing the use of the RobotDrive class.
 * The SampleRobot class is the base of a robot application that will automatically call your
 * Autonomous and OperatorControl methods at the right time as controlled by the switches on
 * the driver station or the field controls.
 *
 * The VM is configured to automatically run this class, and to call the
 * functions corresponding to each mode, as described in the SampleRobot
 * documentation. If you change the name of this class or the package after
 * creating this project, you must also update the manifest file in the resource
 * directory.
 *
 * WARNING: While it may look like a good choice to use for your code if you're inexperienced,
 * don't. Unless you know what you are doing, complex code will be much more difficult under
 * this system. Use IterativeRobot or Command-Based instead if you're new.
